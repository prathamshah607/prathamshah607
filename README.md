# Oh hi, I’m Pratham!

Nice to see you :)

Just your friendly neighborhood tech enthusiast. I dive into AI, cybersecurity, and building nifty tools to make life easier (just keep swimming, just keep swimming..)

### Here's some of my work

- **[Athena-v1](https://github.com/prathamshah607/search_engine):** A Wikipedia-powered search engine with a slick Flutter front-end.  
- **BugBounty Portal:** A JS-based platform to help find and fix vulnerabilities.  
- **Invigilation Scheduler:** Streamlining exam invigilation schedules with Flutter + Supabase.
- **[Pythia](https://github.com/prathamshah607/Pythia):** Agentic LLMs combined with ArXiv for dynamic searching and learning via research papers. RAG-based LLM tutor and explainer.  
- **[Athena-v2](https://github.com/prathamshah607/Search-AI-Agent/blob/master/react_agent_langgraph.ipynb):** AI Agent blending DuckDuckGo, Wikipedia, and Qwen2.5 for smarter search with context.
- A feed-forward neural network from scratch using numpy and pandas, with a 95.5% accuracy in classifying image matrices.
- Plus 25+ ML algorithms implemented — from classics like Logistic Regression to state-of-the-art transformers.

I specialise in NLP, Agentic LLMs and RAG Systems.
